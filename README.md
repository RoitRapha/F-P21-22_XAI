##Team and project  description
*This notebook is the documentation of the result of an university project work of the HTW university of applied science. Developed by a group of Master students in mechanical engineering. The aim is to investigate different methods for determining relevant properties of the classification. For this purpose, forms of dimension reduction are also to be considered. The results from this are to be suitably visualized and evaluated with previously defined criteria.*
